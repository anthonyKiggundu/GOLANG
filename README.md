# GOLANG
Metricbeats experience with Go and Kafka
I will share my experience building my Kafka module based on Metricbeats.
Based on the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/5.6/creating-beat-from-metricbeat.html

# Requirements 
- Go installed and in your PATH 
- Other requirements are as indicated on the above source page

During building or compiling of the Golang code, you might have to manually clone and copy required repositories to your ../beat_name/vendor/ directory.
